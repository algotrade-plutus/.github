# ALGOTRADE PLUTUS
Welcome to the GitHub page of ALGOTRADE PLUTUS, an open-source organization sponsored by ALGOTRADE.

This organization aims:
- To develop an open-source framework for the algorithmic trading field.
- To promote and host open-source projects that follow the standards from ALGOTRADE for public use.
- To be the place for the algorithmic trading community (especially in Vietnam).

To get started, explore the PLUTUS Standard guidelines [here](https://github.com/algotrade-research/plutus-guideline).

Below is a list of our sample projects. Each project has a PLUTUS Compliance Score that shows its compliance with the PLUTUS Guidelines.

Three badge levels go with the Compliance Score:
- ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PLUTUS-<score>-%23BA8E23) is for a project's score ranging from 50% to 69%. 
- ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PLUTUS-<score>-darkgreen) is for a project's score ranging from 70% to 99%.
- ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PLUTUS-100%25-purple) is reserved for projects with a score of 100%, flagship projects to promote the PLUTUS Guidelines.

Furthermore, the
- ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PLUTUS-Sample-darkblue) is given to projects that are selected to become PLUTUS Sample Project, featured in [PLUTUS Standard Guideline](https://github.com/algotrade-course/plutus-guideline/)
- ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PLUTUS-PROTO-%23880A88) is given to projects in the `PROTO` algorithm series developed by ALGOTRADE.
